    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red junglefowl</a>, with attributes of
        wild species such as grey and ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
        is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is
        a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>
    <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[4] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[5] There are more chickens in the world than any other
        bird.[5] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language
        and literature.</p>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and an adult female is called a
        'hen'.[11][12]

        Other terms are:

        'Biddy': a newly hatched chicken[13][14]
        'Capon': a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
        'Chick': a young chicken[15]
        'Chook' /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[16]
        'Cockerel': a young male chicken less than a year old[17]
        'Dunghill fowl': a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[18]
        'Pullet': a young female chicken less than a year old.[19] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
        immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[20]
        'Yardbird': a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[21]
        'Chicken' was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to its
        usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in
        American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or
        'domestic fowl'.[22]

        'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[23]</p>

    <p>Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even
        animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.[30]

        The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[31] The world's oldest known chicken lived
        16 years according to Guinness World Records.[32]

        Eggs from different breeds
        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny,
        pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder
        colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the
        rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made
        by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in
        certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest
        on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called
        wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles.
        Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A
        'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the
        chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[33]</p>
